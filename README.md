## Project Overview
This project is a low-power image acquisition solution based on the CamThink Event Camera NeoEyes NE101. The main features include:

- Support for multiple trigger conditions to wake up autonomously
- Low-power image acquisition
- Transmission of image data to the cloud via MQTT protocol

## Hardware Preparation

### Required Equipment

- Standard development board (integrated with camera sensor)

### Optional Communication Modules

1. CAT1 Cellular Communication Module
2. Halow WIFI Module

> For detailed hardware specifications, please refer to the [hardware introduction document](https://wiki.camthink.ai/docs/NeoEyes%20NE101%20Series/Overview).

## Software Environment Setup

### 1. Obtain the ESP-IDF Development Framework

This project is developed based on ESP-IDF v5.1.6. Please follow the steps below to configure:

```bash
